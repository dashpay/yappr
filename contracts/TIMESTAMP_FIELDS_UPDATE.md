# Timestamp Fields Update for Yappr Contract

## Issue
The `$createdAt` and `$updatedAt` system fields were being used in indices but were not included in the required fields arrays. This causes these fields to not be automatically populated by the Dash Platform.

## Solution
Added the appropriate timestamp fields to the required arrays for all document types that use them in indices.

## Changes Made

### Documents with `$createdAt` added to required:
1. **profile** - Now requires `$createdAt` (used in createdAt index)
2. **post** - Now requires `$createdAt` (used in ownerAndTime, timeline, and replyToPost indices)
3. **like** - Now requires `$createdAt` (used in ownerLikes and postLikes indices)
4. **repost** - Now requires `$createdAt` (used in ownerReposts and postReposts indices)
5. **follow** - Now requires `$createdAt` (used in following and followers indices)
6. **bookmark** - Now requires `$createdAt` (used in ownerBookmarks index)
7. **list** - Now requires `$createdAt` (used in ownerLists index)
8. **listMember** - Now requires `$createdAt` (used in listMembers index)
9. **block** - Now requires `$createdAt` (used in ownerBlocks index)
10. **mute** - Now requires `$createdAt` (used in ownerMutes index)
11. **directMessage** - Now requires `$createdAt` (used in conversation and senderMessages indices)
12. **notification** - Now requires `$createdAt` (used in ownerNotifications and unreadNotifications indices)

### Documents with `$updatedAt` added to required:
1. **avatar** - Now requires `$updatedAt` (used in updatedAt index)

## Important Notes
- These system fields MUST be in the required array for the platform to automatically populate them
- The platform will handle setting these values - the application doesn't need to provide them
- This change requires updating the contract on the platform (new contract deployment)

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated contract to testnet
2. Update the contract ID in the application
3. No application code changes needed - the platform will automatically populate these fields
